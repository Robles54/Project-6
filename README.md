Tutorial:
First start the server and then two clients using the Store class. Then set the socket on both clients to "localhost" and 32007. Then click the add ships button and add coordinates for "ships" (just singular spheres in those locations). The x and y values should be between 1 and 4 inclusively. Then save the ships and hit the start button on both clients. On the first client enter x and y values in the respective boxes (between 1 and 4 again) and click send. Then the second client should hit receive which will show where the first client attacked. The second client should now enter coordinate values and hit send, and the first client should hit receive. The clients can go back and forth until one has hit all three "ships" or circles.
